## M02001. Creating and Manipulating Arrays (★) 
The following variables are created in advance using `randi` and will be used for solving questions. 

```matlab
val1 = randi(100);
val2 = randi(100);

vec1 = randi(100, 10, 1);
vec2 = randi(100, 1, 5);

mat1 = randi(100, 10, 5);
mat2 = randi(100, 5, 10);
mat3 = randi(100, 10, 5);
```

You need to write a script that creates a variable named:
(a) 'vec_a' that is copied from 'vec1'. Then, the value of the third element in 'vec_a' is changed to 'val1'.   
(b) 'vec_b' that is copied from 'vec1'. Then, the values of the third and fifth elements in 'vec_b' are changed to 'val1'.   
(c) 'vec_c' that is copied from 'vec2'. Then, the values of the third and fifth elements in 'vec_c' are changed to 'val2'.   
(d) 'vec_d' that is a row vector and is copied from the second row of 'mat1'.   
(e) 'vec_e' that is a column vector and is copied from the first column of 'mat2'.    
(f) 'mat_f' that is a matrix. The first, second, and third columns of 'mat2' are concatenated in the row (horizontal) direction and assign it to 'mat_f'.    
(g) 'mat_g' that is a matrix. The first, second, and fifth columns of 'mat2' are concatenated in the row (horizontal) direction and assign it to 'mat_g'.    
(h) 'mat_h' that is a 10 x 6 matrix. 'mat1' and 'vec1' are concatenated in the row direction, and assign it to 'mat_h'.    
(i) 'mat_i' that is a 11 x 5 matrix. 'mat3' and 'vec2' are concatenated in the column direction, and assign it to 'mat_i'.    
(j) 'mat_j' that is a 20 x 5 matrix. 'mat1' and 'mat3' are concatenated in the column direction, and assign it to 'mat_j'.

## M02003. Pressure Calculation (★)

'press1', 'press2' and 'press3' contain pressure data that are collected from Station 1, 2, and 3, at 1hr intervals, starting at 6:00AM and ending at 11:00PM (all 18 measurements in each location). Here are the script to generate synthetic values for these variables.  

```matlab
press1 = randi([10 30], 18, 1);
press2 = randi([0 20], 18, 1);
press3 = randi([10 30], 18, 1);

area_device_const = randi(100); % constant cross-sectional area of pressure measuring devices
area_devices = randi(100, 3, 1); % different cross-sectional area of pressure measuring devices
```

Please write a script to  
(a) create a matrix 'data_press'. 'press1', 'press2', and 'press3' are concatenated in the row direction and assign the resulting matrix to 'data_press'.  For example, the first column in 'data_press' indicate the measurements at Station 1.   
(b) create a 1 x 3 vector called 'data_press_9am' which contains the data collected at 9:00 am from all stations.   
(c) create a matrix 'data_press_new' that is copied from 'data_press'. 
You realized that the data from Station 2 was abnormally low (underestimated) and should be corrected by adding 10.  Please correct the corresponding values in 'data_press_new'.   

The force acting on the pressure measuring devices can be calculated using the equation , where F is force, P is pressure and A is a cross-sectional area of the pressure measuring device.  
(d) If the cross-sectional areas of the devices at all Stations are constant and given as 'area_device_const'.  Please convert pressure data in 'data_press_new' to force data, and assign the resulting matrix to 'data_force1'. Note that 'data_press_new' and 'data_force' are same dimension.    
(e) If the cross-sectional areas of the devices at Stations are different and their areas are given as 'area_devices'.  Please convert pressure data in 'data_press_new' to force data, and assign the resulting matrix to 'data_force2'.   
(f) You still do not trust the data from Station 2. Please create a 18 x 3 matrix named 'data_press_good' that is copied from 'data_press'.  Please remove all data from Station 2 in 'data_press_good'. Thus, 'data_press_good' becomes a 18 x 2 matrix.   

Note that you do not need to consider units for pressure data and areas.

## M02005. Replicating built-in functions of fliplr and flipud (★★)

Before starting this problem it is important to understand exactly what the fliplr and flipud functions do ('lr' stands for left and right, and 'ud' stands for up and down).
For those who need review, the fliplr function is used to swap columns of any matrix is reverse order, while the flipud function does the same but for rows.  
flipud: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/flipud.html  
fliplr: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fliplr.html  

a) Given an n x n matrix named 'n_mat', replicate the `fliplr` function without actually using it (flip the order of the columns). Use 'fliplr_mat' copied from 'n_mat' as the unknown variable for this question.   
b) Given an n x n matrix named 'n_mat', replicate the `flipud` function without actually using it (flip the order of the rows).  Use 'flipud_mat' copied from 'n_mat' as the unknown variable for this question.

## M02006. Array Manipulation (★★)

You need to write a script that creates a variable named :   
(a) 'vector1' that contains a 1 x 30 row vector and its elements are 1 through 30 in order.   
(b) 'vector2' that contains vector1 with a reverse order.  
(c) 'vector3' that contains a vector ('vec_tmp') in reverse order. For example, if vec_tmp is [4 3 2 1 5], vector3 becomes [5 1 2 3 4].  
(d) 'matrix1' that contains a 3 x 30 array joining 'vector1', 'vector2', and 'vector3' in a column direction (vertical) and in order.   
(e) 'matrix2' that is copied from 'matrix1'. Then, swap elements in first and second rows of 'matrix2' and then swap elements in second and third columns of 'matrix2'. 

For example, assume that mat1 = [1 2 3; 4 5 6]. After swapping rows, 'mat1' becomes [4 5 6;1 2 3]. Then, swapping columns makes 'mat1' [4 6 5;1 3 2].

(c) 'vec1', which is a row vector containing all the elements from the second to the seventeenth element of 'mat1' in terms of a linear indexing order.  
(d) 'vec2', which is a 1x30 row vector conataining integer numbers from 1 to 30.
(e) 'mat_e', which is a 5x6 matrix reshaped from 'vec2' in order.    
(f) 'mat_f', which is a reverse "linear indexing" order of 'mat1'. For instance, suppose that mat1 is [1 3 5; 2 4 6]. Then, mat2 becomes [6 4 2;5 3 1]

## M02008. 3D Matrix Problems (★★) 

MATLAB uses multiple functions and operations that allow you to create and modify matrices in the third dimension.   
a) Construct a 3 x 3 matrix filled with n. Use 'n_mat' as the name for the matrix.  
b) 'mat_3d' is copied from 'n_mat'. Append 'mat1' at the second location (layer) in the depth (third) dimension.  
c) 'mat_3d2' is copied from 'mat_3d'. Replace the elements located in the first row of the second layered array with n.  
d) Concatenate 'mat_3d2' and 'mat2' in the depth direction and assign this new matrix to 'mat_3d3'. This creates a 3 x 3 x 3 array.   
e) 'mat_3d4' is copied from 'mat_3d3'. Replace the matrix at the third location (layer) in the depth dimension with a 3 by 3 identity matrix.

data_press = [press1 press2 press3];
clearvars press1 press2 press3 % delete 'press1', 'press2', 'press3' variables

area_device_const = randi(100); % constant cross-sectional area of pressure measuring devices
area_devices = randi(100, 3, 1); % different cross-sectional area of pressure measuring devices
```

Please solve the following questions using 'data_press', not using 'press1', 'press2', and 'press3'.

(c) Create a 1 x 3 row vector called 'data_press_9am_2nd' which contains the data collected at 9:00 am of the 2nd day from all stations in order.  
(d) Create a 3 x 10 matrix called 'data_press_9am' which contains the data collected at 9:00 am of all ten days from all stations.  For instance, the first row of 'data_press_9am' contains measurements at 9:00 am of all ten day from Station 1.   
(e) Create a 3 x 18 matrix called 'data_press_5th' which contains the data collected at the whole day of the 5th day from all stations.  For instance, the third row of 'data_press_5th' contains measurements at the whole day of the 5th day from Station 3.   
(f) You realized that the data from Station 2 was abnormally low (underestimated) and should be corrected by adding 10. Create 'data_press_new', which is copied from 'data_press'. Then, please add 10 to all measurement data from Station 2 in 'data_press_new'. 

The force acting on the pressure measuring devices can be calculated using the equation , where F is force, P is pressure and A is a cross-sectional area of the pressure measuring device.  
(g) If the cross-sectional areas of the devices at all Stations are constant and given as 'area_device_const'.  Please convert pressure data 'data_press_new' to force data, and assign the resulting matrix to 'data_force_const', respectively.   Note that the size of 'data_force_const' is 18 x 30. 
(h)  If the cross-sectional areas of the devices at stations are different and their areas are given as 'area_devices'.   Please convert pressure data in 'data_press_new' to force data, and assign the resulting matrix to 'data_force_diff'.   
(i) You still do not trust the data from Station 2. Please create 'data_force_new' which is copied from 'data_force_const'.  Then, remove all measurements from Station 2 in 'data_force_new'. Note that the size of 'data_force_new' is 18 x 20.   

Note that you do not need to consider units for pressure data and areas.

For this problem create several mirrored vectors named:  
a) 'vec1' with dimensions 1 x 2n in which a 1:n vector is mirrored after the nth number. (e.g., if n is 4, then vec1 = [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]).  
b) 'vec2' with dimensions 1 x (2n-1) in which n is the middle element of the vector. (e.g., if n is 5, then vec2 = [1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1]).  
c) 'vec3' with dimensions (2n-1) x 1 in which a 1:n (reverse vector) is mirrored at 1 (e.g.,  if n is 4, then vec3 = [4;3;2;1;2;3;4]).  
d) 'vec4' with dimensions 1 x (3n-2) in which n number of n is the middle of the mirrored vector. (e.g., if n is 4 then vec4 = [1 2 3 4 4 4 4 3 2 1] or if n is 5 then vec4 = [1 2 3 4 5 5 5 5 5 4 3 2 1]).

## M02015. Character Vector Manipulation (★★★)

Refer to the ASCII table when solving this question: https://www.rapidtables.com/code/text/ascii-table.html

The following variables are created in advance using `randi` and will be used for solving questions. 

```matlab
charvec_ran = char(randi([65 122], 1,4)); % a randomly generated character vector
vec1 = randi([65 122],1,4) % a randomly generated vector
```

You need to write a script to create a variable named:  
(a) a  vector 'vec_a', which converts the character vector 'charvec_ran' to its numerical (ASCII) equivalent.  
(b) a  vector 'vec_b', which converts the values of 'vec1' to a character vector.  
(c) a char vector 'vec_c' that is copied from 'vec_b'. The last element is removed.  
(d) 'is_upper1' to test if the fist element of 'vec_c' is an uppercased letter?   
(e) 'is_lower1' to test if the fist element of 'vec_c' is a lowercased letter?   
(f) 'num_upper' to count how many uppercased letters contained in 'vec_c'.  
(g) 'num_lower' to count how many lowercased letters contained in 'vec_c'.  

Please note the video solution shows how to solve part f and g in two different ways. One of the ways it shows is using loop statements, you will learn about these in Module 5 so please focus on the first way to solve these questions for this module.

This program is to use matrix and element-wise operations. Assume that matrix A, a column vector c, and a row vector r are defined as follows. 

![](img/M02016_1.PNG)

Then, val_a, mat_b, mat_c, mat_d, mat_e, and val_f are defined as follows. 

![](img/M02016_2.PNG)

These values should be computed from A, c, and r through matrix and element-wise operations. Individual allocation of the elements is not permitted. Please write a script to compute 'val_a', 'mat_b', 'mat_c', 'mat_d', 'mat_e', and 'val_f' when numeric values for 'A', 'c', and 'r' are given.  For example, when c = [1;2;3] and r = [1 1 0], 'val_a' become 3 (=1x1 + 2x1 + 0).


**Solution**

```matlab
A = randi(100, 3,3);
c = randi(100, 3,1);
r = randi(100, 1,3);

val_a = r*c;
mat_b = A - c*ones(1,3);
mat_c = A .*(ones(3,1)*r);
mat_d = A * c;
mat_e = A * transpose(r);

val_f = mat_d(1) + mat_d(2) + mat_d(3);

## M02021. Pressure Calculation I (★★)    

'press1', 'press2', 'press3', and 'press4' contain pressure data that have been collected over a period of 13 days from Station 1, 2, 3, and 4 at 2 hr 
intervals, starting at 10:00AM and ending at 2:00 am (all 9 measurements per day at each station). Here is the script to generate synthetic values for these variables.

```matlab
press1 = randi([10 30], 9, 13); % data contained at station 1
press2 = randi([0 20], 9, 13); % data contained at station 2
press3 = randi([10 30], 9, 13); % data contained at station 3
press4 = randi([10 60], 9, 13); % data contained at station 4

data_press = [press1 press2 press3 press4]; % joining all staions data in the horizontal direction (a 9 x 52 matrix)
clearvars press1 press2 press3 press4 % delete 'press1', 'press2', 'press3', 'press4' variables

area_devices = randi(100, 4, 1); % different cross-sectional area of pressure measuring devices
```
'press X' is a 9 x 13 matrix including all pressure data from Station X. 9 rows means 9 different times when measurements were taken and 13 columns means 13 different days of data collecting. 

a) Your boss wants you to find all of the pressure gradients from 12 pm to 8 pm during the 7th day of analysis from all stations. Create an 5  x  4 matrix named as 'data_report', where each column represents pressure data recorded from 12 pm to 8 pm on the 7th day of analysis. For example, the first column of 'data_report' is the pressure data at Station 1 measured on the 7th day from 12 pm to 8 pm. 

b) Your boss asks you to calculate the force based on the data analysis from each station at 10 am from days 2 to 10. However, your boss says that Station 4 is 
really old and that the data cannot be trusted, and thus you are asked to **exclude** that data. The force acting on the pressure measuring devices can be calculated using the equation , where F is force, P is pressure and A is a cross-sectional area of the 
pressure measuring device.

The cross-sectional areas of the devices at stations are different and their areas are given as 'area_devices'. Each numbered element in 'area_devices' corresponds to the station number.(eg. The first element of 'area_devices' corresponds to station 1)

Create a 3 x 9 matrix named 'final_data_report' such that the data can be reported in this manner.  Each row corresponds to the time at which Station X has recorded a pressure value, while each column contains the day in which the measurement was taken (from days 2 to 10). For example, the first row of 'final_data_report' is the force data at 10 am for day 2 to day 10 from Station 1 in order. 

**Solution**

```matlab
press1 = randi([10 30], 9, 13); % data contained at station1
press2 = randi([0 20], 9, 13); % data contained at station 2
press3 = randi([10 30], 9, 13); % data contained at station 3
press4 = randi([10 60], 9, 13); % data contained at station 4

data_press = [press1 press2 press3 press4]; % joining all staions data in the horizontal direction (a 9 x 52 matrix)
clearvars press1 press2 press3 press4 % delete 'press1', 'press2', 'press3', 'press4' variables

area_devices = randi(100, 4, 1); % different cross-sectional area of pressure measuring devices

%a)
data_report = data_press(2:6,[7 20 33 46]);

% option 1
% data_report=[data_press(2:6,7),data_press(2:6,20),data_press(2:6,33),data_press(2:6,46)]'

%b)
force_at_st1 = data_press(1,2:10) * area_devices(1);
force_at_st2 = data_press(1,15:23) * area_devices(2);
force_at_st3 = data_press(1,28:36) * area_devices(3);

final_data_report = [force_at_st1; force_at_st2; force_at_st3];
```

```
(a) Create a 1x16 row vector called 'vec_a', which is copied from the last row of 'mat1'. Then, re-arrange it so that the elements in its first half are switched with those in the second half. (e.g. the original vector: [1 2 3 4 5 6]; the modified vector: [4 5 6 1 2 3])

(b) Create a matrix called 'mat_b', which is copied from 'mat1'. Then, swap the first row with the second row, and swap the first column with the second column. (Note that you need to do these steps in order)

(c) Create a 16x4 matrix called 'mat_c', which concatenates every fourth columns of 'mat1' (the first, fifth, ninth, thirteenth columns).

(d) Create a matrix called 'mat_d', which is copied from 'mat_c'. Then, replace the every third element of 'mat_d'  with n (starting from the first element) in terms of the linear indexing.

'press X' is a 13 x 12 matrix including all pressure data from Station X. 13 rows means 13 different times when measurements were taken and 12 columns means 12 different days of data collecting. 

a) Your boss wants you to find all of the pressure gradients from 11 am to 3 pm during the 10th day of analysis from all stations. Create an 9 x 5 matrix named as 'data_report', where each row represents pressure data recorded at a certain time interval from all stations. For example, the first column of 'data_report' is the pressure data at Station 1 measured at 10th day from 11 am to 3 pm. 

b) Your boss asks you to calculate the force based on the data analysis from each station at 10 am from days 3 to 12. However, your boss says that Station 4 is really old and that the data cannot be trusted, and thus you are asked to exclude that data.  

The force acting on the pressure measuring devices can be calculated using the equation , where F is force, P is pressure and A is a cross-sectional area of the pressure measuring device. The cross-sectional areas of the devices at stations are different and their areas are given as 'area_devices'. Each numbered element in 'area_devices' corresponds to the station number. (e.g. the first element of 'area_devices' corresponds to station 1)

Create a 4 x 10 matrix named 'final_data_report' such that the data can be reported in this manner. Each row corresponds to the time at which Station X has recorded a pressure value, while each column contains the day in which the measurement was taken. For example, the first row of 'final_data_report' is the force data at 10 am for day 3 to day 12 from Station 1 in order. 

**Solution**

```matlab
press1 = randi([10 30], 13, 12); % data contained at station 1
press2 = randi([0 20], 13, 12); % data contained at station 2
press3 = randi([10 30], 13, 12); % data contained at station 3
press4 = randi([10 60], 13, 12); % data contained at station 4
press5 = randi([0 25], 13, 12); % data contained at station 5

data_press = [press1 press2 press3 press4 press5]; % joining all staions data in the horizontal direction
clearvars press1 press2 press3 press4  press5 % delete 'press1', 'press2', 'press3', 'press4', 'press5' variables

area_devices = randi(100, 5, 1); % different cross-sectional area of pressure measuring devices

%a)
data_report = data_press(3:11,[10 22 34 46 58]);

% option 1
% data_report=[data_press(3:11,10),data_press(3:11,22),data_press(3:11,34),data_press(3:11,46) data_press(3:11,58)]'

%b)
force_at_st1 = data_press(1,3:12) * area_devices(1);
force_at_st2 = data_press(1,15:24) * area_devices(2);
force_at_st3 = data_press(1,27:36) * area_devices(3);
force_at_st5 = data_press(1,51:60) * area_devices(5);

final_data_report = [force_at_st1; force_at_st2; force_at_st3; force_at_st5];
