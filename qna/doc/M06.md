- [Q3: The Difference between the ./ and .\ Operator](#Q3)

### Q1: Logical Indexing <a name="Q1"></a> 
**Question:** I understand that Matlab will only accept a logical vector when locating the true or false elements in a vector but I don't understand why? What does making the vector logical change about how the software can read the ones and zeros in the vector?

**Answer**: There are three ways of indexing an array: subscript indexing, linear indexing, and logical indexing. When you use a logical vector as an indexing vector, you are doing the logical indexing.

### Q2: The "./" Operator <a name="Q2"></a> 
**Question:** When do i use ./ operator? only when i have to divide a vector by vector or when i have to divide vector with a scalar or when i have to divide a scalar by a vector or at all the three times?

**Answer**: You don't have to use ./ for vector and scalar division. You can use just the division. How about this?

Please refer to Pages 67 to 69 in Module 2: Vectors and Matrices to understand the differences between Scalar and Array operations.
Check out this page for more information about the ./ function: [Mathworks: rdivide] (https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/rdivide.html) 

### Q3: The Difference between the ./ and .\ Operator <a name="Q3"></a> 
**Question:** I was just wondering, what is the difference between the ./ operator and the .\ operator? I know they are for element-wise division, but what difference does the orientation of the dash make?

**Answer**: Very interesting question. I don't like the \ slash operator because if it is misused, it is a big problem..See my testing

It looks like dot backslash is flip the denominator and numerator. 
Since we can replicate those operations using dot slash, **I would not recommend using it, unless it is necessary.** 
MathWorks has some good documentation about the two functions: 
* ./ (rdivide): https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/rdivide.html 
* .\ (ldivide): https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ldivide.html
